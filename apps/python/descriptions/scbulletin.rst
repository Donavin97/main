scbulletin transforms the parameters of events or origins to various bulletin
formats. Currently supported output formats are:

* 1: autoloc1,
* 3: autoloc3,
* 4: fdsnws,
* 5: kml.


Input Modes
===========

Two modes of parameter input are possible:

#. Dump mode: Fetch all necessary information from database directly. Either
   choose one or more event or origin IDs. The database connection must be given
   with :option:`-d`.
#. Input mode: Provide all event and origin information in XML (:term:`SCML`)
   format from file or stdin. You may filter further by event or origin ID.

If event IDs are given, the preferred origin will be derived and used for printing
information.

.. hint::

   Events and origins are referred to by their public IDs.  They can be provided
   by :ref:`scevtls` and :ref:`scorgls`, respectively, from graphical tools like
   :ref:`scolv` or by database queries supported by :ref:`scquery`. XML files
   can be generated by :ref:`scxmldump` or from other formats by :ref:`sccnv`.


Output Modes
============

The generated content is written to stdout or to a file with option :option:`-o`.
Different output formats are available by command-line options:

* :option:`-1` for **autoloc1**: Print one bulletin per event.
* :option:`-3` for **autoloc3**: Print one bulletin per event.
* :option:`-4` or :option:`--fdsnws` for FDSNWS event text: Print one line per
  event. Useful for generating event catalogs. This option offers an alternative
  to generating event catalogs compatible with :ref:`fdsnws-event <sec-event>`
  CSV format defined by :cite:t:`fdsn`.
* :option:`-5` or :option:`--kml` for KML/GIS file format. The output can be
  viewed, e.g., in *Google Earth*.

By default, the output precision of times or coordinates is optimized for events
at teleseismic or regional distances. Use the option :option:`-e` for
**enhanced** output at higher precision. Then all times and distances are given
with precision of milliseconds and meters, respectively.
Combine options :option:`-3` or :option:`-4` with :option:`-x` for printing more
parameters in generated bulletins.


Examples
========

#. Create a bulletin from one or multiple event(s) in database

   .. code-block:: sh

      scbulletin -d mysql://sysop:sysop@localhost/seiscomp -E gfz2012abcd
      scbulletin -d mysql://sysop:sysop@localhost/seiscomp -E gfz2012abcd,gfz2022abcd

#. Convert XML file to bulletin

   .. code-block:: sh

      scbulletin -i gfz2012abcd.xml

   .. code-block:: sh

      cat gfz2012abcd.xml | scbulletin

   .. code-block:: sh

      scbulletin < gfz2012abcd.xml

#. Convert XML file to bulletin but filter by event ID(s)

   .. code-block:: sh

      scbulletin -i gfz2012abcd.xml -E gempa2022abcd
      scbulletin -i gfz2012abcd.xml -E gempa2022abcd,gfz2022abcd

.. note::

   When considering a single event XML file containing many events, the
   bulletins of all events will be generated unless :option:`--first-only` is
   used.
